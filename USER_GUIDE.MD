![home_screen](https://github.com/KierPalin/MicroData/blob/main/resources/MicroData_1_5.jpg?raw=true)


MicroData is an open-source project meaning that modification and experimentation is encouraged!


# Hardware
* MicroData requires a Microbit V2 and an Arcade Shield to use.
* You only need one Arcade Shield to control other microbits if you are using the Command mode.


# Setup
The latest stable release of MicroData is available ![here](https://github.com/KierPalin/MicroData/releases). Alternatively MicroData can be built using the [MakeCode CLI](https://microsoft.github.io/pxt-mkc/). The README.MD file documents how MicroData can be built from scratch in this way.

# Potential errors
* 540: The .hex download was interrupted or failed. Try downloading the .hex file again. If this happens when using a cmdline tool try building it and copying it to the Microbit manually using the file-explorer.
* 020: Out of memory! Your program is so big that it does not fit in memory anymoreâ€¦ or we have a memory leak somewhere. Try resetting the micro:bit. This could occur if the datalog has a huge number of entries. You could try copying the MY_DATA.HTM file from the Microbit onto your PC and then resetting the datalog - either via MicroData or by deleting the MY_DATA.HTM file that is on the Microbit.
