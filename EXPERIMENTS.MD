# Botany Experiment:
How does the amount of water and the frequency of watering a plant affect its growth?


### Requirements:

​
Setup:​

Each student (or group of students) has a plant, a micro:bit + Arcade Shield and a water plan – which tells them how much to water the plant each day.  The student(s) can setup MicroData to automatically record the light & temperature around the plant and the moisture of its soil each day for 2 weeks. ​



Experiment:​

Each day they will follow their water plan and note down the height of the plant. At the end of the experiment the student(s) can make a table in their notebook(s) from the readings saved on the micro:bit and the corresponding height of the plant.​


The student(s) can then share their results with the class to create a full table of data and analyse how a plant's height is affected by how it is watered.​


MicroData's value:​

This experiment would be difficult to do without MicroData since it requires multiple different sensors – which each group of students require. In addition, they would require another external device to control these sensors – which could be difficult to configure. MicroData makes this easy because the entire process can be done inside one micro:bit application.​
