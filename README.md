# MicroData
The objective of this ongoing project is to create an extension that utilises the Arcade shield and Microbit V2 to create an easy to use data science library. MicroData utilises the variety of sensors & buttons onboard the Microbit to:
⦁	Record data 	
⦁	Create graphs
⦁	View raw data & events in a tabular format
⦁	Perform simple data manipulation & creation


With the objective of allowing people to:
⦁	Teach and better understand Data Science
⦁	Experiment with Physical Computing
⦁	Perform Science Experiments
⦁	Explore the diverse features of the BBC Microbit V2
