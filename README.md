This is an application for the Microbit V2 and an Arcade shield that leverages onboard sensors for scientific experiments inside the classroom - without the need for an external computer. MicroData utilises the variety of sensors & buttons onboard the Microbit to allow you to:
* Record data and events into flash storage
* View real-time graphs of sensor readings.
* Create graphs from recorded data.
* View data & events in a tabular format.
* Supports Jacdac sensors for Light, Soil moisture, Distance, Flex, Temperature and Humidity.

With the objective of allowing people to:
* Teach and better understand Data Science.
* Experiment with Physical Computing.
* Perform Science experiments.
* Explore the diverse features of the BBC Microbit V2.

### Building

You need to use https://makecode.microbit.org/beta currently to build MicroData. You can load this repo into MakeCode using the Import button in the home page and selecting "Import URL".

Please note that there is currently no simulator support for the arcade shield extension (https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcadeshield) that MicroData depends on. 

You will need an Arcade Shield for the micro:bit V2 to make use of MicroData.
